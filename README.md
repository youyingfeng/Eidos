# Eidos
An unoffical AO3 app for Android.

Requires Android 6.0 and above.

## What can it do?
So far, it can search for works by tag (e.g. fandom, relationship, etc.) and read them. It can 
also save works in the Library, and mark works for future reading in the Reading List.

## Usage
Download the debug apk in the release and install it on your android device. Do allow your device to
install apps from unknown sources (before Android 8.0)/install unknown apps (Android 8.0 and above).
