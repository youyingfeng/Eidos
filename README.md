This is an unofficial AO3 app written in Kotlin.

This is intended as an introduction to writing a good android app, which follows all 
the good design principles (e.g. clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, etc).
Additionally, this serves as a platform to refine my UI/UX design skills.

The development phase is expected to be slow, as I am an overworked university student 
with too much work on my hands. I expect it to take about ~6 months before a fully 
functional application is developed.
